# Final Project: Hey Brew

My final project completed at GA was a free for all. One week to complete something uttely spectacular, utilising all of the skills learned over the course of 3 months. I decided I would do this using a Ruby on Rails backend that spoke to a React.js frontend, and make it a super cool single page app that everyone has been going crazy for. It's so hot right now.

## Project Description

My idea was to create a web app where users could order a round of alcoholic beverages, and the order would be ready for them by the time they arived to the pub. The idea was derived from a few existing apps where you can do something similar with food and drink.
