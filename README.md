# Final Project: Hey Brew

My final project completed at GA was a free for all. One week to complete something uttely spectacular, utilising all of the skills learned over the course of 3 months. I decided I would do this using a Ruby on Rails backend that spoke to a React.js frontend, and make it a super cool single page app that everyone has been going crazy for. It's so hot right now.

## Link to live site
<https://hey-brew.herokuapp.com/>

## Tech Used
React.js
Google Maps API
Ruby on Rails
PostgresQL
Heroku 
Pure CSS Animation

## Project Description

My idea was to create a web app where users could order a round of alcoholic beverages, and the order would be ready for them by the time they arrived to the pub. The idea was derived from a few existing apps where you can do the same thing with food and drink.

This is a Rails App at its base. By using the Webpacker gem, I am able to render the React components within the Rails app, and can share both frameworks at the same time. 

I have also used a Google Maps API that is rendered within the React app. I have used the react-google-maps package as I found it to have the best documentation to follow.

The Hey Brew site was definitely one of the hardest things I've ever created and is one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. I'm really proud of what I created especially within the strict time limits we were given.

## Known Bugs

For some reason when I deployed the data to Heroku, some of the css styiling went haywire. Something I am still trying to fix. It works on my computer though.

## Wishlist

Wishlist for the site is the ability to search for a pub using the geolocation tool built in the browser. I have got the data ready at the backend there were just a few more steps needed to get it working.

I would have also have liked to add the Google Map on the show pubs page, with the users current location and a Google Maps route showing how they should get there. Again I have the data posted to the backend, just need to find out how to interact that data with the API.
